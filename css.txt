!important -override any style no matter how specific it is
example: 
p {
    color: blue !important;
} - all p elements will appear blue (should be careful to use this)

tag , tag {} - separate with tag pics both tag seperately- picks them as if they are unrelated  
(without tags picks them together- thinking they are related)

background-image: url - puts a background image on the screen based on an html tag (like any css attribute)
example: 
.class or p {
    background-image: url(""); - this 
}
